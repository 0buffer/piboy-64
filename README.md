# Piboy-64
Original designed by Matthew Carlson
Huge shout out to /u/Ryzee and his GBA project here: https://github.com/Ryzee119/GBA_Emulator-by-Ryzee119-/blob/master/README.md

This is a true N64/PS1 emulator stuffed inside a GBA case. Based around a Raspberry Pi compute module 3 which is smaller but has the same guts as a RPi 3. A zero just didn't seem to cut it. Perhaps in the future, I'll do another version with the zero inside as well but for now I'll stick with this.

Details of how to build this and photos can be found on https://hackaday.io/project/17935-piboy-64

##DISCLAIMER:
This is a complex board with lots of parts. Make sure you know what you're doing. Surface mount soldering isn't hard but it is not for beginners. I used a third party replacement case for my GBA body and they vary from vendor to vendor so be flexible if what you have is different than what I did.

I take no responsibility for the following:

1.	You went ahead and purchased everything, soldered it up and it didn’t work because reasons.
2.	You soldered an SMD chip and done broke the pins.
3.	If a component in the BOM is not available or becomes obsolete, use your best judgement to find a replacement. I highly recommend parts.io which can provide risk factors and compatible chips.
4.	A component is missing from the BOM or you ordered parts you didn't need. (Look at the schematic before ordering)
5.	The thing burst into flame and explodes in your hands and burns your house down.
6.	It doesn’t fit in your GBA case


Any advice and support I provide from this point is purely out of the kindness of my heart.

## Making your own
So you read this whole thing and still want to make your own? Well. Let's get started then. Visiting the hackaday.io link will give you detailed build instructions. I'll try and document as I go.

Good luck.
